        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pesto or the pesto alla genovese is a traditional Italian sauce made with fresh basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic, salt, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil.</p>
        <p>This chicken pesto pasta is easy and delicious. Serve with crusty bread and salad for a quick dinner. Use as much or as little pesto sauce as you like. Using homemade pesto will taste even better, but it adds to prep time. Enjoy!</p>
